# SMS Spam Detection using NLP

This project implements an SMS spam detection system using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques. The model is built with **Multinomial Naïve Bayes (MultinomialNB)** classifier and trained on a dataset of SMS messages. The goal is to classify SMS messages as **spam** or **ham** (non-spam).

### Key Features
- **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stopword removal, and text cleaning.
- **Feature Extraction**: TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization for transforming raw text into numeric features.
- **Modeling**: Multinomial Naïve Bayes classifier for SMS message classification.
- **Evaluation**: Model performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains SMS messages labeled as **spam** or **ham**. You can either use your own dataset or find publicly available datasets, such as the **SMS Spam Collection Dataset**.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/SMS-Spam-Detection-NLP-Classifier.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd SMS-Spam-Detection-NLP-Classifier
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. **Train the Model**:
   To train the Multinomial Naïve Bayes classifier, run:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

2. **Evaluate the Model**:
   To evaluate the model and visualize performance metrics:
   ```bash
   python evaluate_model.py
   ```

3. **Make Predictions**:
   To classify new SMS messages as spam or ham:
   ```bash
   python predict_sms.py --sms "Free entry in a contest..."
   ```

### Technologies Used
- **Python**  
- **Scikit-learn**  
- **NLTK**  
- **Pandas**  
- **NumPy**  
- **Matplotlib** (for visualizations)
